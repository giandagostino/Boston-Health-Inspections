# "Boston Health Inspections: Geospatial Analysis"

Created using data from the City of Boston, I've created geospatial visualizations of the city and assessed significance of restaurant density (whether the restaurant is in an urban or suburban area) in relation to health inspection records. The health inspection records span from 2008-2025.

## Results:

#### There is evidence to suggest that suburban restaurants tend to fail health inspections more often than urban restaurants, from Chi-Squared Test for independence, and spline regression.
